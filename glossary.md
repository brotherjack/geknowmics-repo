# Disambiguation Glossary of Genomics Terms

This glossary is for defining terms whose definition can not easily be found via a search engine. In technical fields it is not uncommon for words to have different meanings depending on context, or for words to have developed meanings from a specific practice or tradition, or just simple haphazard usage that unintentionally evolves within a discipline. This glossary serves as a means of clearing up these potential roadblocks on the way to a better understanding of genomics.

It **should be noted** however that these definitions are those of the authors of this guide. As with any set of complex terms, there is likely to be a wide range of disagreement on certain definitions, even if most practitioners would largely agree on most of the definitions of said set of terms.

## A
- ### Amplicon
	- _(in context of genomics and bioinformatics)_
	- A fragment of DNA/RNA that has been copied. This copying can happen naturally, but in context this is virtually always the result of thermocycling/polymerase chain reactions.

- ### R Group
	- _(in context of organic chemistry)_
	- Represents any combination of atoms and bonds that contains at least 1 carbon or hydrogen atom.

- ### Residue
	- _(in context of amino acid/polypeptide)_ 
	- Possible misconception: "Is the [R group](#R-group) of an amino acid molecule."
	- Technically the residue of an amino acid in a peptide is all of the atoms of that amino acid that remain after the condensation reaction that adds it onto the peptide.
