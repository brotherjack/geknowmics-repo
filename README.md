# GenKNOWmics Repository of Information, Code, and Cool Stuff

Genomics is a fast-moving and broad interdisciplinary field, and this is why UCF's BSC 4445 does not have a textbook. While publishers generally like to publish new editions of textbooks, these usually consist of minor additions and updates to bring the text up to modern understandings and practices (and to make institutions, and _you_, buy a new book). It would be unfeasible for the authors to rewrite the entire text every couple years or so.

For a new, fast moving, and broad field, such as genomics, textbooks generally don't exist. At least, not until there is a standard set of practices and an established intellectual foundation. This does not mean that there is no stable information for students and neophytes on the subject. On the contrary, there is **_sooooo much_** information. Much of this information will wind up being useful for many years, but in the meantime it is diffuse among many different journals, blogs, company and university websites, on binders and post-notes, and in a cave where Tim lives and will not disclose any information without the successful completion of his many riddles.   

This makes it difficult, especially for someone who is still working on an undergraduate degree in biology, _how do you find the right information when you don't necessarily know what you're looking for?_

That is where this repository comes in. This is a curated knowledge base that you can use to help build your knowledge and point you in the right direction on developing an understanding of genomics.

Using this repository is not mandatory for this course. You can develop a broad introduction to genomics by participating in the lab-work and paying attention to the lectures. However, the key word in the previous sentence is _**introductory**_, if you want to develop a deeper understanding you'll need to continue studying outside and beyond the duration of this course. The material here can help you continue your genomics journey.

That said, this repository can also help you do better in _this_ course too.

Usually books on computer tech over 10 years old can be dicey, but for a technology like git this is not an issue, as the end-user experience has remained largely consistent since then. It's not particularly long, and I don't think you would need to read it all. I would recommend starting with chapters 1-3 and 6, then following up with 7 which will help with the finer points.
